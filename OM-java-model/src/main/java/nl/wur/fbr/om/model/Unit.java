/**
 * A unit of measure is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention and/or by law.
 * It is used as a standard for measurement of the same quantity, where any other value of the quantity can be
 * expressed as a simple multiple of the unit of measure. For example, length is a quantity; the metre is a unit of
 * length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metre (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times
 * the definite predetermined length called "metre".
